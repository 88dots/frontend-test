# React Developer Coding Test
## Background
ðŸŽ® Using React and TypeScript, create a library for interacting with the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/Using_the_Gamepad_API).

## Requirements
- [ ] Should provide the ability to connect Gamepad events to React components. For instance, pressing button A opens a menu.
- [ ] Should provide the ability to visualize the state of the Gamepad. For instance, an on-screen controller widget highlights X when you press X.
- [ ] Should provide the ability to use the joysticks, dpads, not just the buttons.
- [ ] Should provide a demo application to test the functionality.
- [ ] Should provide documentation on how to use library.

## Bonus
- [ ] Include debugger tool that could be enabled as part of the library.
- [ ] Include unit tests or other automated tests.
- [ ] Propose how the library could be used, modified, or designed to allow directional navigation between a page's elements. For instance, pressing dpad up moves selection to a new element.
